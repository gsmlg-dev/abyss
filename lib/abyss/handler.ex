defmodule Abyss.Handler do
  @moduledoc """
  `Abyss.Handler` defines the behaviour required of the application layer of a Abyss server.

  # Example

  Another example of a server that echoes back all data sent to it is as follows:

  ```elixir
  defmodule Echo do
    use Abyss.Handler

    @impl Abyss.Handler
    def handle_data(data, state) do
      Abyss.Transport.UDP.send(state.socket, data)
      {:continue, state}
    end
  end
  ```

  Note that in this example there is no `c:handle_connection/2` callback defined. The default implementation of this
  callback will simply return `{:continue, state}`, which is appropriate for cases where the client is the first
  party to communicate.

  Another example of a server which can send and receive messages asynchronously is as follows:

  ```elixir
  defmodule Messenger do
    use Abyss.Handler

    @impl Abyss.Handler
    def handle_data(msg, state) do
      IO.inspect(msg)
      {:continue, state}
    end

    def handle_info({:udp, socket, ip, port, data}, state) do
      Abyss.Transport.UDP.send(socket, ip, port, msg)
      {:noreply, state, state.read_timeout}
    end
  end
  ```

  Note that in this example we make use of the fact that the handler process is really just a GenServer to send it messages
  which are able to make use of the underlying socket. This allows for bidirectional sending and receiving of messages in
  an asynchronous manner.

  You can pass options to the default handler underlying `GenServer` by passing a `genserver_options` key to `Abyss.start_link/1`
  containing `t:GenServer.options/0` to be passed to the last argument of `GenServer.start_link/3`.

  Please note that you should not pass the `name` `t:GenServer.option/0`. If you need to register handler processes for
  later lookup and use, you should perform process registration in `handle_connection/2`, ensuring the handler process is
  registered only after the underlying connection is established and you have access to the connection socket and metadata
  via `Abyss.Transport.UDP.peername/1`.

  For example, using a custom process registry via `Registry`:

  ```elixir

  defmodule Messenger do
    use Abyss.Handler

    @impl Abyss.Handler
    def handle_data(recv_data, state) do
      {ip, port, data} = recv_data
      Abyss.Transport.UDP.send(state.socket, ip, port, data)
      {:continue, state}
    end
  end
  ```

  This example assumes you have started a `Registry` and registered it under the name `MessengerRegistry`.

  # When Handler Isn't Enough

  The `use Abyss.Handler` implementation should be flexible enough to power just about any handler, however if
  this should not be the case for you, there is an escape hatch available. If you require more flexibility than the
  `Abyss.Handler` behaviour provides, you are free to specify any module which implements `start_link/1` as the
  `handler_module` parameter. The process of getting from this new process to a ready-to-use socket is somewhat
  delicate, however. The steps required are as follows:

  1. Abyss calls `start_link/1` on the configured `handler_module`, passing in a tuple
  consisting of the configured handler and genserver opts. This function is expected to return a
  conventional `GenServer.on_start()` style tuple. Note that this newly created process is not
  passed the connection socket immediately.
  2. The raw `t:Abyss.Transport.socket()` socket will be passed to the new process via a
  message of the form `{:abyss_received, listener_socket, server_config, acceptor_span,
  start_time}`.
  3. Your implenentation must turn this into a `to::inet.socket()` socket by using the
  `Abyss.Transport.UDP.new/3` call.
  4. Your implementation must then call `Abyss.Transport.UDP.handshake/1` with the socket as the
  sole argument in order to finalize the setup of the socket.
  5. The socket is now ready to use.

  In addition to this process, there are several other considerations to be aware of:

  * The underlying socket is closed automatically when the handler process ends.

  * Handler processes should have a restart strategy of `:temporary` to ensure that Abyss does not attempt to
  restart crashed handlers.

  * Handler processes should trap exit if possible so that existing connections can be given a chance to cleanly shut
  down when shutting down a Abyss server instance.

  * Some of the `:connection` family of telemetry span events are emitted by the
  `Abyss.Handler` implementation. If you use your own implementation in its place it is
  likely that such spans will not behave as expected.

  @doc """
  This callback is called whenever client data is received after `c:handle_connection/2` or `c:handle_data/3` have returned an
  `{:continue, state}` tuple. The data received is passed as the first argument, and handlers may choose to interact
  synchronously with the socket in this callback via calls to various `Abyss.Transport.UDP` functions.

  The value returned by this callback causes Abyss to proceed in one of several ways:

  * Returning `{:close, state}` will cause Abyss to close the socket & call the `c:handle_close/2` callback to
  allow final cleanup to be done.
  * Returning `{:continue, state}` will cause Abyss to switch the socket to an asynchronous mode. When the
  client subsequently sends data (or if there is already unread data waiting from the client), Abyss will call
  `c:handle_data/3` to allow this data to be processed.
  * Returning `{:continue, state, timeout}` is identical to the previous case with the
  addition of a timeout. If `timeout` milliseconds passes with no data being received or messages
  being sent to the process, the socket will be closed and `c:handle_timeout/2` will be called.
  Note that this timeout is not persistent; it applies only to the interval until the next message
  is received. In order to set a persistent timeout for all future messages (essentially
  overwriting the value of `read_timeout` that was set at server startup), a value of
  `{:persistent, timeout}` may be returned.
  * Returning `{:error, reason, state}` will cause Abyss to close the socket & call the `c:handle_error/3` callback to
  allow final cleanup to be done.
