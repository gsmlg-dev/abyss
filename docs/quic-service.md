# General-purpose QUIC service

Abyss hosts UDP I/O and binds application consumers to `elixir_quic` connections.
The QUIC engine owns connection IDs, TLS, streams, flow control, recovery and
packetization. Applications own their protocols. DNS/DoQ and HTTP/3/QPACK are
permanently outside Abyss; raw stream examples do not implement either.

## Dependency activation and application integration

Ordinary `Abyss.start_link/1` UDP usage does not load or require elixir_quic. A QUIC
application explicitly adds both Abyss and the engine to its dependencies:

```elixir
{:abyss, "~> 0.6.1"},
{:elixir_quic, "== 0.17.0"}
```

The published engine uses OTP application `:elixir_quic` and facade `Quic`;
its source is `gsmlg-dev/http_fetch` under `apps/elixir_quic`. It requires Hex `ex_ssl`
`0.17.0`, whose TLS facade remains `SSL.QUIC`. Abyss does not provide a legacy
`QUIC` alias or fall back to an older engine. The examples pin these published
packages and use `ABYSS_PATH` only to select the Abyss checkout under test.
Do not set `runtime: false` on these runtime dependencies.

Implement `Abyss.QUIC.Handler` and add the listener to your supervisor:

```elixir
{Abyss.QUIC,
 name: MyApp.QUICListener,
 ip: {127, 0, 0, 1}, port: 4433,
 alpn: ["my-stream-protocol-v1"],
 tls: [cert: certificate_der_chain, key: {key_type, key_der}],
 handler: {MyApp.QUICHandler, handler_options},
 max_connections: 128,
 quic_options: [retry: true, streams: [max_data: 16_384, max_stream_data: 16_384]]}
```

Certificate material uses the public ex_ssl/elixir_quic TLS contract. `alpn` is a
nonempty list of opaque identifiers (each 1–255 bytes). TLS negotiates one; Abyss
does not inspect application payloads or route protocols on the same socket.
Readiness/ALPN is not application authorization. This server subset does not
authenticate client identity with mTLS; applications must provide any required
client authentication at their own protocol layer.
Bind a concrete address; wildcard destination metadata is unsupported upstream.
`local/1` returns `{:ok, {address, bound_port}}`; `stop/2` stops a listener.
Startup errors are explicit; no QUIC option silently activates ordinary UDP.
Credential structure is checked using the public `SSL.QUIC.new/2` API before
starting the listener. Actual connection transcripts are created by elixir_quic.

Listener options, besides `name`, `handler`, `alpn` and `tls`, are:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ip`, `port` | `{127, 0, 0, 1}`, `0` | Concrete bind address; zero chooses a port |
| `max_connections` | 128 | Endpoint and consumer ceiling |
| `init_timeout` | 5000 ms | Attachment and handler initialization bound |
| `callback_timeout` | 5000 ms | One event batch and its callbacks |
| `shutdown_timeout` | 1000 ms | Total cooperative worker drain bound |
| `poll_interval` | 10 ms | Consumer event/credit polling interval |
| `event_batch` | 32 | Engine events per poll, range 1–128 |
| `writer_timeout` | 1000 ms | Local writer operation timeout |
| `writer_max_queue` | 128 | Queued plus in-flight datagrams |
| `writer_max_bytes` | 1,048,576 | Queued plus in-flight payload bytes |
| `quic_options` | `[]` | Supported engine limits and timers |

All host limits/timeouts are finite positive integers. Supported engine options
are `retry`, `retry_ttl` (microseconds), `retry_limit`, `event_limit`,
`operation_limit`, `handshake_timeout`, `idle_timeout`, `closing_timeout`,
`draining_timeout` (engine timers in milliseconds), and `streams`. Stream limits
are `max_data`, `max_stream_data`, `max_stream_data_bidi_local`,
`max_stream_data_bidi_remote`, `max_stream_data_uni`, `max_streams_bidi`,
`max_streams_uni`, `max_buffer`, `max_ready_bytes`, `max_stream_records` and
`max_recv_ranges`. Unknown options and overrides of engine I/O, TLS or ownership
are rejected. `_backend` is a private host-test seam, not a supported engine plugin API.

`child_spec/1` uses transient restart: an explicit normal `stop/2` stays stopped;
host failures restart under the application's supervisor with fresh generations.
Choose the `stop/2` call timeout and supervisor child shutdown timeout longer than
`shutdown_timeout`. A stop-call timeout does not confirm listener termination.

The independent projects `examples/quic_echo` and `examples/quic_collect` each
have their own application supervisor, handler and custom ALPN. Copy either
project to another directory and set `ABYSS_PATH` to this repository (or replace
the path dependency with a reviewed package). Set `QUIC_CERT`, `QUIC_KEY` and
optionally `QUIC_PORT`, then run `mix deps.get` and `mix run --no-halt`. Credentials
are PEM files converted to DER by the example application. Test fixtures are
not deployment credentials. `examples/udp_echo` demonstrates dependency-free
ordinary UDP consumption.

## Consumer ownership and byte streams

A listener owns its socket, one blocking receive process, writer and endpoint.
A persistent worker per accepted connection attaches through the public engine
API and executes application callbacks. There is no process per packet or stream.
Initialization/binding precedes data callbacks. Peer stream-open precedes data
readiness. Before attachment, the engine retains bytes and events within its
finite limits; overflow terminates the connection rather than silently dropping
application events. The attached worker alone reads and drains events.

`init(connection, metadata, options)` returns `{:ok, state}` or `{:error, reason}`.
Metadata includes peer/local addresses and negotiated ALPN. `handle_event(event,
state)` returns `{:ok, state}` or `{:stop, reason, state}`. An optional
`terminate(reason, state)` handles local teardown. Application code runs outside
shared reception and writing. Use bounded application queues, and choose read
credit deliberately. A slow consumer must not accumulate arbitrary data in its
own state after removing it from the engine's bounded buffers.
The worker also delivers `:tick` after each bounded event batch; this lets a
consumer resume partial reads or definitely blocked writes. Polling applies to
consumer events, not UDP reception, which uses a blocking receive loop. Callbacks
share one aggregate deadline per batch, including the engine event call and
`:tick`; the next poll is scheduled after that batch completes. Attachment,
metadata lookup and initialization likewise share `init_timeout`.
Failed initialization, attachment,
crashes and callback timeout close only that connection. Teardown callbacks are
best effort; forced termination can skip them.
`{:closed, reason}` is delivered once when the worker processes its matching
engine close notification. It can describe transport/TLS/engine termination,
and is not guaranteed during worker crashes or forced shutdown. Use process
ownership/monitors for lifecycle observation that must survive callback failure.

Listener shutdown stops ingress first, notifies its workers, waits for at most
the configured drain interval, then terminates remaining host components and
closes its socket. Writer/endpoint/receiver failure fails the listener closed.
Existing connections are not resumed across restart. Watchdogs run in the service
process; suspending that process delays watchdog enforcement and new binding,
while already attached consumers and the writer continue to progress.

Connection handles carry engine generations; streams embed their connection
handle and stream ID. Treat them as opaque. The facade delegates `ready`, `info`,
`events`, `open_stream`, `read`, `send_stream`, `reset_stream`, `stop_stream`,
`close` and `operation_status` to public engine operations. No endpoint-private
connection enumeration is part of the consumer API.
The event vocabulary is `{:ready, metadata}`, `{:stream_open, stream, :bidi | :uni}`,
`{:readable, stream}`, `{:stopped, stream, code}` and `:writable`, followed by
the worker's `:tick`. Only the attached worker may read or drain events. Normal
handlers consume the supplied events rather than calling `events/3` again.
Serialize other application work through a bounded queue; arbitrary concurrent
local callers are not given bounded BEAM mailboxes by this API.

A read consumes at most 16 KiB and returns ordered `{:data, id, bytes}`,
`{:fin, id}` or `{:reset, id, code, final_size}` items. A write admits at most
16 KiB and can split into many UDP datagrams. Neither write nor callback boundaries
are message boundaries. FIN closes only that sending direction: receiving may
continue. Reset and stop are directional stream operations. Closing one connection
does not close the listener socket or other connections.

## Backpressure and errors

`send_stream` returns an operation reference on admission, `{:blocked, reason}`
when no admission occurred, or an error. `{:unknown, ref}` means a call timed out
and its operation may have happened. Use `operation_status/2` where possible;
never blindly retry with a new reference. The engine caches a bounded number of
operation results; eviction or process death can make an outcome unresolvable.
Admission is not local UDP completion and neither is a peer acknowledgement.
No public per-write peer-delivery receipt is supported.
Unknown outcomes also apply to destructive reads and event pulls, not only writes.
Resolve their cached result before issuing another operation. Pass the connection
handle to `operation_status/2`, including for references returned by stream
operations; a stream handle is not an operation-status target. Options `:ref`,
`:timeout` and `:deadline` follow the engine's public consumer contract.

Stream consumption advances transport receive credit. Engine limits are supplied
under `quic_options[:streams]`; callbacks decide how many bytes to consume. Engine
readable/writable events coalesce. A handler must retain at most its chosen bounded
pending output when blocked and wait for progress before retrying definite blocks.
Admission is all-or-nothing for each write. For small peer windows, choose chunks
smaller than the remaining credit: a full 16 KiB pending write can otherwise wait
indefinitely when the peer replenishes credit only after consuming half its
window. The echo example uses 1 KiB echo chunks and separately demonstrates one
initial 16 KiB write. The collection example hashes bounded reads incrementally.

Transport, TLS and local application-worker failures retain their distinct reason
terms. Application close/reset/stop codes are opaque 62-bit integers passed
unchanged to elixir_quic; bounded binary reasons are not mapped to HTTP or DNS errors.
The independent writer contract is documented in [dispatcher.md](dispatcher.md).

## Capability limits and acceptance

The engine supports the scoped QUIC v1, certificate-based 1-RTT bidi/uni byte-stream
subset. Server mTLS, DATAGRAM, resumption/0-RTT, migration, wildcard/ancillary local-address
metadata, external client endpoints, HTTP/3/QPACK and WebTransport are unsupported.
Finite stream tombstones can exhaust the lifetime stream-record budget. This is
not full conformance or a production security audit.

See [published-quic-acceptance.md](published-quic-acceptance.md) for the published
engine regression and [phase1-acceptance.md](phase1-acceptance.md) for the original tested source,
commands, failures and gate status. Unit/fake-backend tests are host regressions;
only the separate pinned-peer results count as real network acceptance.
